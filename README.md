# Summer Project - CloudflarePages and CloudflareWorkers
This website was made to have a single button on it that can be clicked to generate a random google search.
I learned how to use CloudflarePages and CloudflareWorkers on this project.

This project was a lot of fun because it required me to think about not only the coding process but also the implementation of scripts into websites and creating a frontend interface that a user can interact with.
